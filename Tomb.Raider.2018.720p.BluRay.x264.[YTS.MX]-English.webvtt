00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:56.343
May 17th. 2009.

3
00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:58.978
Further research on Himiko.

4
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.483
According to legend. Himiko.
the first queen of Japan.

5
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:05.286
was a powerful sorceress

6
00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:08.822
who ruled her empire
through dark magic.

7
00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:10.958
spreading death
and destruction

8
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.859
by the mere touch of her hand.

9
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.264
She was only stopped
by a single twist of fate.

10
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.635
An army of her own generals
bound and dragged Himiko

11
00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:23.704
to an uninhabitable island

12
00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.806
in the middle of
the treacherous Devil's Sea.

13
00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:32.213
There. she remains entombed
beneath the mountains.

14
00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:36.951
I found a speck on an old map
that no one else has.

15
00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:38.784
And she's there.

16
00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:40.589
waiting to be unleashed.

17
00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:45.993
I have to get there first.

18
00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:47.826
Even if it means
doing the last thing

19
00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:50.496
I'd ever want to do...

20
00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:53.536
Leaving my Lara behind.

21
00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.003
You gotta
make decisions. Lara.

22
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.504
You gotta make
something happen.

23
00:02:04.347 --> 00:02:05.811
Counter-punching
doesn't work for you.

24
00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.480
You don't have the skill.

25
00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:09.118
- Thanks. Terry.
- You're welcome.

26
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.788
Come on. Lara!

27
00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.661
Stop dancing. start fighting.

28
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:22.332
Yes. girl!

29
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.501
Come on!

30
00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:37.147
Nice one. Lara!
You've got this!

31
00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.384
- It's over.
- Isn't!

32
00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:44.951
Then get out of it!

33
00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:53.929
Come on. Lara! Tap out.

34
00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.481
Don't say it.

35
00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:17.117
You got whupped. girl.
You got whupped.

36
00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.356
- Not whupped.
- Okay. Not whupped.

37
00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.057
Marmalized.

38
00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.759
"Marmalized"? She's not
a freakin' superhero.

39
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.496
Truth is. I let her...

40
00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:31.867
We cool?

41
00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:34.237
Yeah. we're cool.

42
00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:39.140
Was fun actually!

43
00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:40.210
Thanks.

44
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.815
I'll get you next time.

45
00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:49.082
I'll marmalize you.

46
00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:52.485
You're home early
tonight. right?

47
00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:54.454
Yup.

48
00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:56.256
Catch you later.

49
00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:57.456
Laters.

50
00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.694
Hey! Who stole my apple?

51
00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:05.165
Should've known it was you.

52
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:06.999
Why would I do
a thing like that?

53
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:09.336
'Cause you can't afford
your own.

54
00:04:09.338 --> 00:04:11.372
Just seen you're behind
with your payments.

55
00:04:11.374 --> 00:04:13.740
Terry. look. I'll catch up
on the payments. I promise.

56
00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:15.611
I'll make it up to you.

57
00:04:17.047 --> 00:04:19.048
Get a job. Lara.

58
00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:22.814
Do you think I'm dressed
like this for fun?

59
00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:26.156
I like you. Lara.
I really do. but...

60
00:05:04.993 --> 00:05:06.793
- Hey.
- Hi.

61
00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:09.029
- All good?
- Yeah. Havin' a great day.

62
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:10.033
You?

63
00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:13.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

64
00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:16.804
Ask her more. Ask her for
dinner or something. Do it.

65
00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:18.471
Come on.

66
00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:19.674
Anything else?

67
00:05:21.144 --> 00:05:22.778
No. no. no.

68
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.284
What is your problem?
Why didn't you ask her?

69
00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:31.686
Stupid boy.

70
00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:42.862
You got that fox hunt
sorted. Rog?

71
00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:44.831
Yeah. more or less.

72
00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:47.867
Got 30 hounds signed up.
Just gotta find a fox now.

73
00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.836
- Tough one. that.
- Mmm.

74
00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:51.371
Need someone quick enough
to make it interesting.

75
00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:53.207
Yeah. No fun
if they ain't quick.

76
00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:54.974
But dumb enough
to think they can win.

77
00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:56.909
What are you two plotting?

78
00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.145
We're gonna do a fox hunt.

79
00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:01.015
- A what?
- Well. it's like a race.

80
00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:02.781
Except the fox gets
a head start.

81
00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:04.318
leavin' a paint trail
behind his bike.

82
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.884
For the baying hounds
to follow.

83
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:07.653
And if they haven't caught him

84
00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:08.989
by the time
the paint runs out...

85
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.111
He wins all the money.

86
00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:12.492
How much money?

87
00:06:12.494 --> 00:06:14.163
600 quid.

88
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.797
I think you just
found yourself a fox.

89
00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:23.102
Oh. you're bein' serious?

90
00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.737
Not quick or dumb enough
for you?

91
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.409
No. I mean. I just...

92
00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.909
You're on.

93
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:31.877
"Hide fox. and all after!"

94
00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.914
Ooh. Shakespeare?

95
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.816
Hamlet. is it?

96
00:06:35.818 --> 00:06:37.682
Don't know.
Things just stick in my brain.

97
00:06:37.684 --> 00:06:39.352
You know it's Hamlet.

98
00:06:39.354 --> 00:06:40.955
And I ask you once again.

99
00:06:40.957 --> 00:06:43.190
why on earth
are you a bike courier?

100
00:06:43.192 --> 00:06:44.394
You. Bruce.

101
00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:48.096
I wanna be close to you.

102
00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:20.692
Five. four. three.
two. one! Go!

103
00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:31.407
Hey!

104
00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:56.365
Excuse me!

105
00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:23.891
Go. go. go!

106
00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:28.029
Where is she. bro?

107
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.473
I won't be long.
my love.

108
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:28.587
- Oi! Watch where you're going!
- Use your mirrors!

109
00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:38.664
Go! Go!

110
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.144
Fancy seeing you here.

111
00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:51.777
Ana.

112
00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.313
You didn't have to come.

113
00:09:53.315 --> 00:09:55.547
I don't need
a guardian anymore.

114
00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:56.985
Really?

115
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.156
Have you been decorating?

116
00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:06.226
Haven't seen you
for a long time.

117
00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:08.330
You've never seen me.

118
00:10:12.867 --> 00:10:14.304
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.704
Thanks for coming.

120
00:10:18.073 --> 00:10:19.708
What was today about?

121
00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:22.642
I needed the money.

122
00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:25.245
No. you don't.
There's an inheritance

123
00:10:25.247 --> 00:10:26.947
waiting for you
if only you would step...

124
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:28.151
I won't.

125
00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:32.321
It's been seven years. Lara.

126
00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:37.590
Tokyo police stopped looking
for your father

127
00:10:37.592 --> 00:10:40.059
five years ago.

128
00:10:40.061 --> 00:10:43.631
Private investigators won't
even take our money anymore.

129
00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:46.933
I know it's difficult
to accept.

130
00:10:46.935 --> 00:10:49.936
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

131
00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:52.939
Hmm. That's why you came.

132
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:56.442
No. I came for you.

133
00:10:56.444 --> 00:10:58.677
Just think what you can do
for the world.

134
00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.778
with your potential.
with your wealth.

135
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.085
His wealth. Not mine.

136
00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:08.488
Listen. it's very simple...

137
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.623
If you don't sign the papers.

138
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:14.726
then everything your father
worked for will be sold off.

139
00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:16.598
Not just the company.

140
00:11:17.832 --> 00:11:19.701
but Croft Manor. also.

141
00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:25.773
Can you imagine how he would
feel if you lost the house?

142
00:11:30.645 --> 00:11:34.280
Lara. your father's gone.

143
00:11:34.282 --> 00:11:37.518
But you can pick up
where he left off.

144
00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:40.288
It's in your blood.

145
00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:46.727
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:48.263 --> 00:11:50.699
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

147
00:12:08.817 --> 00:12:11.817
But I don't
want you to go. Daddy.

148
00:12:11.819 --> 00:12:13.588
I won't be long. my love.

149
00:12:15.357 --> 00:12:17.357
You must understand.

150
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:21.260
We Crofts. we have
responsibilities. jobs to do.

151
00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:22.962
But I'll miss you.

152
00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:25.464
I know. I'll miss you. too.

153
00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.469
But I may have
a solution to that.

154
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.436
See this?

155
00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:33.273
This was your mother's.
so it has special powers.

156
00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:35.141
What do you mean?

157
00:12:35.143 --> 00:12:36.909
Ever you want to feel close
to someone.

158
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:39.512
just put it in your hand.
and you hold it tightly.

159
00:12:39.514 --> 00:12:42.715
And you think of that person.
and they'll know.

160
00:12:42.717 --> 00:12:44.387
- Really?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:45.253 --> 00:12:46.953
It's magic.

162
00:12:46.955 --> 00:12:49.055
And it means
that we'll always be together.

163
00:12:49.057 --> 00:12:50.891
wherever I am.

164
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.261
Okay?

165
00:13:00.268 --> 00:13:02.404
I'll be back
before you know I'm gone.

166
00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:32.267
Oi!

167
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:35.034
Couriers round the back.

168
00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:37.272
Uh. I'm not a courier.

169
00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:39.371
Well. I am.

170
00:13:39.373 --> 00:13:41.843
Right. So round the back.

171
00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:50.816
I'm here to see Ana Miller.

172
00:13:50.818 --> 00:13:53.386
Well. you gotta
sign in like everyone else.

173
00:13:53.388 --> 00:13:54.854
What's your name?

174
00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:56.688
Lara.

175
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.091
Lara.

176
00:13:58.093 --> 00:13:59.660
Croft.

177
00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:06.299
The pages
that require a signature

178
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:09.204
are marked
for your convenience.

179
00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:12.338
Would you like Mr. Yaffe

180
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.740
to take you
through the particulars?

181
00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:16.179
I gather I sign

182
00:14:17.912 --> 00:14:19.644
and Dad is dead.

183
00:14:19.646 --> 00:14:22.783
I can imagine
how difficult this is for you.

184
00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:27.454
I miss him. too.

185
00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:45.005
That was Dad's.

186
00:14:45.007 --> 00:14:48.173
Yes. Miss Croft.
According to Richard's will.

187
00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:50.910
in the event of his death

188
00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.611
I was to give it to you.

189
00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:56.418
Karakuri. Japanese puzzle.

190
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.218
Um. technically speaking.

191
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.855
you're meant to sign
the papers first.

192
00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:07.826
I could never understand

193
00:15:07.828 --> 00:15:10.163
your father's obsession
with those things.

194
00:15:10.165 --> 00:15:12.265
Wouldn't believe
how many of these

195
00:15:12.267 --> 00:15:13.831
were lying around the house.

196
00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.968
There was gonna be
some purpose to it.

197
00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:52.471
"The first letter
from my final destination."

198
00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:55.344
But he didn't leave a letter.

199
00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:05.320
- If you'll excuse me.
- Lara. I...

200
00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:56.537
"My final destination."

201
00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:06.082
The first letter.

202
00:18:07.308 --> 00:18:08.542
What the...

203
00:18:34.634 --> 00:18:36.603
Dad. what were you up to?

204
00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:51.150
Hello. sprout.

205
00:18:51.152 --> 00:18:53.718
I knew I could trust you
to solve my puzzle.

206
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.688
Unfortunately. if you're
watching this tape.

207
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.860
then. uh. it means
that I must be dead.

208
00:19:00.862 --> 00:19:02.695
It'll be obvious to you by now

209
00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:04.697
that there was more to my life

210
00:19:04.699 --> 00:19:06.764
than just boardrooms
and business deals.

211
00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:09.936
Things that I couldn't
tell you about before.

212
00:19:09.938 --> 00:19:14.040
When your mother died.
grief nearly destroyed me.

213
00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:16.109
I began searching the world.

214
00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:20.213
desperate for a hint
of another realm.

215
00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:24.284
for proof that
the supernatural is real.

216
00:19:24.286 --> 00:19:28.055
Anything to feel her
with me again.

217
00:19:28.756 --> 00:19:31.625
I made quite
a hobby of it. sprout.

218
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:34.326
Now...

219
00:19:34.328 --> 00:19:36.295
I need you to do me a favor.

220
00:19:36.297 --> 00:19:39.430
I need you to burn
all my research

221
00:19:39.432 --> 00:19:40.698
on the Himiko project.

222
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.635
Just burn all of it.

223
00:19:42.637 --> 00:19:44.204
The notebooks.
the tapes. everything.

224
00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:45.906
It's very important.

225
00:19:45.908 --> 00:19:47.540
If it falls
into the wrong hands.

226
00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:48.975
then it could be catastrophic.

227
00:19:48.977 --> 00:19:51.178
so please do it straightaway.

228
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.478
I know you hate
being told what to do.

229
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.184
but please promise me that.

230
00:19:57.186 --> 00:20:00.188
I hope you never
have to see this tape.

231
00:20:00.688 --> 00:20:03.223
But if you do.

232
00:20:03.225 --> 00:20:05.727
you've found
my secret calling.

233
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:10.065
I hope you find yours.

234
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.539
Dad loves you.

235
00:20:41.862 --> 00:20:43.265
"Himiko."

236
00:20:53.107 --> 00:20:55.140
October 5th.

237
00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:57.944
They called Queen Himiko
the "Mother of Death."

238
00:20:57.946 --> 00:20:59.844
All the stories about her

239
00:20:59.846 --> 00:21:01.780
end in rivers
running red with blood.

240
00:21:01.782 --> 00:21:04.985
Bewitching people.
controlling minds.

241
00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:06.851
spreading death
and destruction

242
00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:08.520
with just
the touch of her hand.

243
00:21:08.522 --> 00:21:10.488
The bloodshed only ended

244
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.159
when her own generals
buried her alive in a tomb.

245
00:21:13.161 --> 00:21:15.427
sealing her away
from the outside world.

246
00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:18.098
on an island
no one could reach.

247
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.666
History's all but erased
its existence.

248
00:21:21.668 --> 00:21:24.339
The lost island of Yamatai.

249
00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:27.375
I'm certain this is the place.

250
00:21:28.775 --> 00:21:31.577
July 29th. 2011.

251
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:33.312
I finally found a captain

252
00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:35.348
willing to take me
to the island.

253
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.118
I must get there first
to ensure her powers

254
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.021
will never fall
into the wrong hands.

255
00:21:57.271 --> 00:21:59.072
Uh...

256
00:21:59.074 --> 00:22:01.473
That amulet was given
to my father

257
00:22:01.475 --> 00:22:04.412
by Emperor Showa of Japan.

258
00:22:04.844 --> 00:22:07.112
Right. Right. Well...

259
00:22:07.114 --> 00:22:09.613
This ain't from Japan.

260
00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:11.317
You're correct.

261
00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:13.085
Emperor Showa
was given it by the grandson

262
00:22:13.087 --> 00:22:14.852
of the former emperor
of Maratha.

263
00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:17.856
"Maratha"? You're having
a laugh. in't ya?

264
00:22:17.858 --> 00:22:19.658
And he. himself.
got it from Thibaw.

265
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.026
the last king of Burma

266
00:22:21.028 --> 00:22:22.861
when he was exiled in India.

267
00:22:22.863 --> 00:22:24.896
- "Exiled in India."
- Mmm.

268
00:22:24.898 --> 00:22:26.764
What a fascinating tale.

269
00:22:26.766 --> 00:22:28.832
And you got
all this. uh. provenance

270
00:22:28.834 --> 00:22:30.468
down on paper. do ya?

271
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.170
If I had
the provenance on paper.

272
00:22:32.172 --> 00:22:34.239
I'd be at Christie's.
wouldn't I?

273
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:36.409
But. um...

274
00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:38.311
This is your lucky day.

275
00:22:38.313 --> 00:22:39.844
Is it?

276
00:22:39.846 --> 00:22:41.413
Alan!
What have I told you

277
00:22:41.415 --> 00:22:43.416
about flirting
with the customers?

278
00:22:43.418 --> 00:22:44.984
I'm not flirting. I'm just
naturally charismatic.

279
00:22:44.986 --> 00:22:46.388
I was not flirting. I'm sorry.

280
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.554
I was flirting.

281
00:22:49.556 --> 00:22:50.891
Have a look.

282
00:22:58.733 --> 00:23:00.898
Big smiles. nice and casual.

283
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:02.802
Right. well.
I'm pleased to say

284
00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:05.207
we're in a position
to make you an offer.

285
00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:08.443
Ten.

286
00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:12.780
Please?

287
00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:15.715
Just a tad bit more.

288
00:23:15.717 --> 00:23:17.849
That's all I have
to remember my dad by.

289
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:20.585
Oh. Oh. your dad died.

290
00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:23.188
That's a shame.
It's a terrible thing

291
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.957
for a young woman
to lose her father.

292
00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:27.127
Really. All right.
Fair enough.

293
00:23:27.129 --> 00:23:28.862
9.000.

294
00:23:29.296 --> 00:23:30.527
You just said 10.

295
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:32.098
Well. people come in here

296
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.864
trying the dead dad shit
all the time.

297
00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:35.434
And you fall for it
all the time.

298
00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:37.236
I don't fall for it
all the time.

299
00:23:37.238 --> 00:23:38.637
Last week.
you fell for it twice.

300
00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:39.771
I fell for it twice.

301
00:23:39.773 --> 00:23:41.505
It's the truth.

302
00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:43.243
Fine. I'm happy
to keep negotiating.

303
00:23:43.245 --> 00:23:44.445
Because now
the price is eight.

304
00:23:46.146 --> 00:23:48.847
- Okay. You win.
- Ah. finally.

305
00:23:48.849 --> 00:23:51.082
Thank you. Really.

306
00:23:51.084 --> 00:23:52.850
Thank you.

307
00:23:52.852 --> 00:23:55.456
For just
such occasions.

308
00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:00.492
For just such occasions.

309
00:24:00.494 --> 00:24:01.994
You burnt me taters!

310
00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:03.396
Sort yourself out. Alan.
Seriously.

311
00:24:03.398 --> 00:24:04.398
That is hot coffee.

312
00:24:39.401 --> 00:24:41.967
Excuse me.
do you speak English?

313
00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:43.804
Sorry. no.

314
00:24:44.705 --> 00:24:46.942
No? Thank you.

315
00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:50.609
Sorry. Excuse me.

316
00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:54.514
Do you know a Lu Ren? Lu Ren?

317
00:24:54.847 --> 00:24:56.850
Not even a tiny bit?

318
00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:02.687
- Do you speak English?
- Lady.

319
00:25:02.689 --> 00:25:03.991
You need help?

320
00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:08.194
Yes. I do.

321
00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:11.965
I'm looking
for this guy called Lu Ren.

322
00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:13.698
Um. he's supposed to...

323
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.801
- Lu Ren boat.
- Yes.

324
00:25:15.803 --> 00:25:17.269
Endurance. Over there.

325
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:18.940
"Endurance"? Which one?

326
00:25:21.176 --> 00:25:22.311
Oi!

327
00:25:23.577 --> 00:25:24.912
Wait!

328
00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:23.034
Stay back.

329
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:28.642
Gimme the bag.

330
00:26:41.589 --> 00:26:42.991
You just lost your tip.

331
00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:46.427
You just lose your tongue.

332
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.434
Lu! Lu Ren!

333
00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:30.171
Help! Help!

334
00:27:45.452 --> 00:27:47.487
Run! Run! He's drunk again!

335
00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:53.061
Thank you.

336
00:27:56.663 --> 00:27:58.428
What?

337
00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.032
I said what
are you doing on my boat?

338
00:28:00.034 --> 00:28:01.632
I'm not with them.

339
00:28:01.634 --> 00:28:03.668
I'm looking for a man
named Lu Ren.

340
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.438
Congratulations. you found me.
Now get lost.

341
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.376
Please. Wait.
Just listen. I need...

342
00:28:10.378 --> 00:28:12.111
Okay. let's go.

343
00:28:12.113 --> 00:28:13.211
I'm not here
to make any trouble.

344
00:28:13.213 --> 00:28:15.114
Keep walking.

345
00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:17.015
Could you please
put that gun down and just...

346
00:28:20.786 --> 00:28:22.324
Oh. for God's sake.

347
00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:29.427
My father. Richard Croft.
tried to buy a boat from you.

348
00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:32.563
No. No. Not me. he didn't.

349
00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:33.800
Yes. he did.

350
00:28:35.402 --> 00:28:38.271
Your name is Lu Ren.

351
00:28:38.273 --> 00:28:40.208
This is from you.

352
00:28:40.874 --> 00:28:44.876
Yes. I know my name. thanks.

353
00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:48.913
It's the same as my father's.
and he wrote that. not me.

354
00:28:51.352 --> 00:28:53.319
Well. then I need
to talk to him.

355
00:28:53.321 --> 00:28:55.353
You and 100 other people
he owed money...

356
00:28:55.355 --> 00:28:58.556
- Where is he?
- I don't know. okay?

357
00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:00.559
One day.
he just left on his boat.

358
00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:03.198
and I never saw him again.
all right?

359
00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:08.303
Was this seven years ago?

360
00:29:12.439 --> 00:29:16.374
I think I know
where they went. Our dads.

361
00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:19.344
To the bottom
of the sea?

362
00:29:19.346 --> 00:29:22.647
They were headed
to an uninhabited island.

363
00:29:22.649 --> 00:29:25.383
Somewhere off the coast
of Japan.

364
00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:27.554
It used to be called Yamatai.

365
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.456
I'm gonna go there
and find out

366
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:32.992
what happened to them.

367
00:29:32.994 --> 00:29:34.626
Good luck. There's at least

368
00:29:34.628 --> 00:29:36.427
6.000 islands
off the coast of Japan.

369
00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:38.397
and hardly any of them
are populated.

370
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.431
Well. I have a map.

371
00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:43.902
Now. all I need to do is to
figure out what these are.

372
00:29:43.904 --> 00:29:46.373
I think these are coordinates.

373
00:29:46.672 --> 00:29:48.242
The location.

374
00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:54.780
They're clock hands.

375
00:29:55.582 --> 00:29:58.516
They're not
clock hands.

376
00:29:58.518 --> 00:30:00.887
Definitely not
clock hands. They're...

377
00:30:05.824 --> 00:30:07.727
They are clock hands.

378
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:16.238
Three...

379
00:30:21.342 --> 00:30:23.675
That's the one.

380
00:30:23.677 --> 00:30:26.744
That's right in the middle
of the Devil's Sea.

381
00:30:26.746 --> 00:30:28.346
You might as well
tie a stone to your foot

382
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.880
and jump off the boat now.

383
00:30:29.882 --> 00:30:31.482
It'll be an adventure.

384
00:30:31.484 --> 00:30:34.919
Death is not an adventure.

385
00:30:34.921 --> 00:30:36.754
Don't you want to know
what happened to them?

386
00:30:36.756 --> 00:30:40.491
I just don't care
anymore. okay?

387
00:30:40.493 --> 00:30:43.298
Look. I'm a busy guy.
I got stuff to do.

388
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.716
How much did you lose
last night?

389
00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:06.284
What makes you think I lost?

390
00:31:06.286 --> 00:31:07.851
Well. it looked like you were

391
00:31:07.853 --> 00:31:10.790
drowning your sorrows.
not celebrating.

392
00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:31.243
Yours if you help me
get to Yamatai.

393
00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:33.647
And what will I spend it on.
a coffin?

394
00:31:34.982 --> 00:31:36.581
Then I'll go and get myself

395
00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:38.316
two rust buckets like this
with that.

396
00:31:38.318 --> 00:31:41.453
Even if you had a boat.
or two.

397
00:31:41.455 --> 00:31:43.457
you'd sink 'em before
you even left the harbor.

398
00:31:44.991 --> 00:31:47.760
What you need
is an experienced captain.

399
00:31:51.332 --> 00:31:53.434
So. what's in the other shoe?

400
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.910
June 23rd.

401
00:32:05.912 --> 00:32:08.879
I may have found
the next piece to the puzzle.

402
00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:11.616
Ancient drawings hint
to the location of the tomb

403
00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:14.820
and an elaborate door
to keep her contained.

404
00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:18.256
I've found a way
to decipher the codes.

405
00:32:18.258 --> 00:32:20.526
I'm sure I can get to her.

406
00:32:29.003 --> 00:32:31.468
The ancient
Nihongi chronicles state

407
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.372
that within the tomb.

408
00:32:33.374 --> 00:32:36.507
one must face
the "Ordeals of Himiko."

409
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:39.776
Cross the Chasm of Souls.

410
00:32:39.778 --> 00:32:43.017
pray to survive
the faces of Himiko.

411
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:50.022
behold her army
of a thousand handmaidens.

412
00:32:50.024 --> 00:32:52.690
descend upon
Himiko's final resting place.

413
00:32:52.692 --> 00:32:54.962
unleashing her scourge.

414
00:33:05.973 --> 00:33:07.906
July 6th. I'm convinced

415
00:33:07.908 --> 00:33:09.775
that my progress
is being monitored.

416
00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:12.143
I know them by name now...

417
00:33:12.145 --> 00:33:13.878
The Order of Trinity.

418
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.948
An ancient
militant organization

419
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.815
that seeks control
over the supernatural

420
00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:21.119
to rule the fate of mankind.

421
00:33:21.121 --> 00:33:23.455
What if Himiko is the weapon

422
00:33:23.457 --> 00:33:25.659
that Trinity has been seeking?

423
00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:36.804
Can't sleep?

424
00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:43.411
It's beautiful.

425
00:33:46.247 --> 00:33:48.112
Enjoy it
while you can.

426
00:33:48.114 --> 00:33:49.982
We're headed into the most
dangerous stretch of water

427
00:33:49.984 --> 00:33:52.686
between Hong Kong
and California.

428
00:33:53.753 --> 00:33:56.457
Your dad sure knew
how to pick a holiday.

429
00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:02.862
Yeah. He had a knack for
the unexpected. Apparently.

430
00:34:06.865 --> 00:34:09.400
I am starting to wonder
if he'd gone mad. though.

431
00:34:11.238 --> 00:34:13.870
He didn't seem to know what
was real and what wasn't.

432
00:34:13.872 --> 00:34:18.477
obsessing over some
ancient Japanese death queen.

433
00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:21.080
Hey. some men
like dangerous women.

434
00:34:21.082 --> 00:34:23.915
Some men are foolish.

435
00:34:23.917 --> 00:34:25.550
What?

436
00:34:25.552 --> 00:34:29.089
Good night. Lu Ren.
Sweet dreams.

437
00:34:45.406 --> 00:34:47.339
Not William Tell yet.
but you're close.

438
00:34:47.341 --> 00:34:49.541
William Tell was a myth. Dad.

439
00:34:49.543 --> 00:34:52.413
Well. all myths
have foundation in reality.

440
00:34:53.613 --> 00:34:55.348
I have to head off. sprout.

441
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.114
But you've only
just come back.

442
00:34:57.116 --> 00:34:59.652
- I'll be back before...
- I even know you're gone.

443
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:03.355
Ana will keep an eye on you.

444
00:35:03.357 --> 00:35:05.689
I don't need one of
your employees babysitting me.

445
00:35:05.691 --> 00:35:07.795
I can take care of myself.

446
00:35:13.134 --> 00:35:14.568
My girl.

447
00:35:17.036 --> 00:35:18.205
Lara

448
00:35:23.178 --> 00:35:24.978
Never forget Dad loves you.

449
00:35:26.047 --> 00:35:27.182
I know.

450
00:36:13.459 --> 00:36:15.561
Thought that might wake you.

451
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.998
Your island's found us.

452
00:36:22.902 --> 00:36:24.071
Yamatai.

453
00:36:36.749 --> 00:36:39.584
We've lost all control!

454
00:36:39.586 --> 00:36:41.785
- We need to abandon ship.
- What?

455
00:36:41.787 --> 00:36:43.521
We're dead
in the water.

456
00:36:43.523 --> 00:36:45.056
It's not gonna hold
much longer.

457
00:36:45.058 --> 00:36:46.338
We need to get off
this boat now.

458
00:37:02.343 --> 00:37:03.544
Wait!

459
00:37:04.644 --> 00:37:06.178
Dad's papers!

460
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.283
Forget them! Lara!

461
00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:23.830
Oh!

462
00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:31.139
Lara. Come on!

463
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:39.613
Lu!

464
00:37:51.724 --> 00:37:53.328
The lifeboat!

465
00:38:17.749 --> 00:38:19.086
Watch out!

466
00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:55.423
Lu!

467
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.658
Lu!

468
00:40:14.733 --> 00:40:16.136
Where am I?

469
00:40:18.537 --> 00:40:21.439
Ah! She's awake.

470
00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:24.145
I was beginning
to get worried about you.

471
00:40:31.152 --> 00:40:32.186
A reef.

472
00:40:33.254 --> 00:40:35.018
You hit it.

473
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.087
Thank God I found you.

474
00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:39.991
Most people who try to
come here die in the currents.

475
00:40:39.993 --> 00:40:42.695
Almost impossible to get here.

476
00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:45.132
Even harder to leave.

477
00:40:49.303 --> 00:40:50.404
Where's my...

478
00:40:56.876 --> 00:40:58.145
Right here.

479
00:41:04.883 --> 00:41:08.055
What are you doing here. Lara?

480
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:14.058
I have two daughters.

481
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.930
Dark hair like you.

482
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:18.865
Pretty like you.

483
00:41:23.404 --> 00:41:27.105
Forgive me. Rude.

484
00:41:27.107 --> 00:41:28.805
I haven't hosted a guest
here in a very long time.

485
00:41:28.807 --> 00:41:31.477
My name is Mathias Vogel.

486
00:41:35.581 --> 00:41:37.250
You must be hungry.

487
00:41:41.588 --> 00:41:43.257
You know. I used to imagine

488
00:41:44.456 --> 00:41:46.524
that I might find an ear

489
00:41:46.526 --> 00:41:49.163
inside one of
those cans eventually.

490
00:41:50.896 --> 00:41:53.397
Isn't that mad?

491
00:41:53.399 --> 00:41:55.767
I guess being on this island
for so long

492
00:41:55.769 --> 00:41:58.568
can make you a little crazy.

493
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.205
The only person
that I get to talk to

494
00:42:01.207 --> 00:42:03.942
is on the other end
of this phone.

495
00:42:03.944 --> 00:42:06.843
And they always say
the same thing...

496
00:42:06.845 --> 00:42:10.283
I can't go home until
my work on the island is done.

497
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:23.261
What kind of work do you do?

498
00:42:23.263 --> 00:42:27.199
Oh. a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.

499
00:42:52.926 --> 00:42:54.593
You looking for this?

500
00:42:57.196 --> 00:43:00.367
The machinations of fate
never cease to amaze me.

501
00:43:02.201 --> 00:43:04.470
"The door to Himiko."

502
00:43:06.871 --> 00:43:08.674
Richard had the entrance.

503
00:43:12.044 --> 00:43:13.914
All that wasted time.

504
00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:18.548
You have brought me the thing

505
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.584
that I most wanted
in this world.

506
00:43:21.586 --> 00:43:22.621
Thank you.

507
00:43:25.724 --> 00:43:28.328
What do you know
about my father?

508
00:43:32.098 --> 00:43:33.998
Now I see the likeness.

509
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.501
The intelligence in the face.

510
00:43:37.503 --> 00:43:39.406
The recklessness.

511
00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:47.443
All he had to do
was cooperate.

512
00:43:47.445 --> 00:43:50.448
Of course. being Richard.
he refused.

513
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.920
Thought he was saving
the world.

514
00:43:53.187 --> 00:43:54.688
Where is he?

515
00:43:59.192 --> 00:44:00.926
Where is he?

516
00:44:00.928 --> 00:44:03.297
He's with God now.
I killed him.

517
00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:11.405
I'm sorry if I was too blunt.
I'm out of practice.

518
00:44:12.038 --> 00:44:14.175
It's been seven years.

519
00:44:15.575 --> 00:44:17.211
Seven years.

520
00:44:30.655 --> 00:44:32.156
Come on.

521
00:44:32.158 --> 00:44:33.525
Come on. come on!

522
00:44:34.726 --> 00:44:36.595
Come on. Get down there.

523
00:44:42.937 --> 00:44:44.671
Get those skids moving!

524
00:44:49.009 --> 00:44:50.441
Move.

525
00:44:50.443 --> 00:44:51.611
Move!

526
00:44:53.813 --> 00:44:55.514
Let's go!

527
00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:57.747
Pick it up!

528
00:44:57.749 --> 00:44:59.386
Come on. go!

529
00:45:02.588 --> 00:45:04.124
Tie her up!

530
00:45:15.902 --> 00:45:18.071
Okay. winch it up!

531
00:45:19.838 --> 00:45:21.307
Back to work.

532
00:45:22.742 --> 00:45:25.143
Lara Croft.

533
00:45:25.145 --> 00:45:27.613
You shouldn't have come here.

534
00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:30.250
But I'm glad that you did.

535
00:45:32.386 --> 00:45:35.922
Pack it up. We're moving camp!

536
00:45:38.458 --> 00:45:42.858
- All right. let's pack it up!
- Okay. move out!

537
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.630
We're moving camp!

538
00:45:51.804 --> 00:45:54.274
Keep it moving!
You. move!

539
00:45:55.308 --> 00:45:56.575
Move it. move it.

540
00:46:06.285 --> 00:46:08.419
Pick it up! Come on. let's go!

541
00:46:08.421 --> 00:46:10.922
Who are these people?

542
00:46:10.924 --> 00:46:14.393
Some are
shipwrecked fishermen.

543
00:46:14.395 --> 00:46:17.129
And some paid smugglers
to take 'em to a better life.

544
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:19.232
Instead.
they brought 'em here.

545
00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:23.234
Come on!
We're backed up here. Move!

546
00:46:23.236 --> 00:46:25.472
He said he killed my dad.

547
00:46:28.706 --> 00:46:30.276
He killed mine.

548
00:46:31.277 --> 00:46:32.512
They saw it.

549
00:46:33.713 --> 00:46:36.183
Cold-blooded murder.

550
00:46:36.548 --> 00:46:37.851
I'm sorry.

551
00:46:40.154 --> 00:46:43.620
I'm sorry
that I brought you here.

552
00:46:43.622 --> 00:46:47.459
Well. you did take advantage
of a drunken sailor.

553
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:51.295
Come on. move!

554
00:46:51.297 --> 00:46:53.599
At least we're not dead yet.

555
00:46:53.731 --> 00:46:55.201
No shit.

556
00:47:42.216 --> 00:47:44.285
I need
some CL 20 up here!

557
00:47:57.163 --> 00:47:58.463
Come on. let's go!

558
00:48:08.075 --> 00:48:10.441
You okay?

559
00:48:10.443 --> 00:48:12.009
Get him up and back to work
right now.

560
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:13.811
Hang on.

561
00:48:13.813 --> 00:48:15.773
- Right now!
- Let him rest. We'll manage.

562
00:48:18.118 --> 00:48:19.615
Get him back
to work right now!

563
00:48:19.617 --> 00:48:22.020
He's sick. man.
He needs to rest.

564
00:49:18.443 --> 00:49:21.078
Get back to work!

565
00:49:29.922 --> 00:49:32.058
You heard him!
Let's get back to work!

566
00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.333
Hey. Lara.

567
00:49:41.335 --> 00:49:43.503
Lara! Get ready.

568
00:49:44.337 --> 00:49:45.538
Hey.

569
00:49:47.406 --> 00:49:48.738
Go!

570
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.775
Go!

571
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.463
Look out!

572
00:50:15.834 --> 00:50:17.570
Let's spread out!
Spread out!

573
00:50:34.953 --> 00:50:36.420
Get her!

574
00:50:36.422 --> 00:50:37.889
Get a move on!

575
00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:44.796
Grab her!

576
00:51:12.724 --> 00:51:16.127
She's in the river.
You want us to follow?

577
00:51:16.129 --> 00:51:17.695
No.

578
00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:19.931
I'm sending Rocket
to track her.

579
00:51:19.933 --> 00:51:23.569
If she survives.
he'll bring her back.

580
00:54:07.733 --> 00:54:08.969
Really?

581
00:58:24.722 --> 00:58:28.425
Easy now. easy.
I'm taking you back to camp.

582
00:58:54.085 --> 00:58:55.955
Stop struggling!

583
01:00:43.595 --> 01:00:44.596
Wait!

584
01:00:56.641 --> 01:00:58.241
No. no. no. no!

585
01:01:33.878 --> 01:01:36.445
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

586
01:01:36.447 --> 01:01:38.683
Just ignore it. It'll go away.

587
01:02:07.445 --> 01:02:08.447
Dad?

588
01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:12.450
It's me.

589
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:19.955
Dad?

590
01:02:19.957 --> 01:02:25.263
It's not real. Ignore it.
It'll go away. It always does.

591
01:02:25.265 --> 01:02:27.664
No. look at me. look at me.

592
01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:28.801
Please.

593
01:02:34.372 --> 01:02:36.474
Do you remember this?
Do you remember:

594
01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:39.379
We used to...

595
01:02:47.552 --> 01:02:48.854
It's me.

596
01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:55.760
It's Lara.

597
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.869
Sprout.

598
01:03:08.606 --> 01:03:11.243
What the blazes
are you doing here?

599
01:03:18.183 --> 01:03:19.751
Dad. I'm hurt.

600
01:03:28.393 --> 01:03:29.760
It's all right.

601
01:03:51.749 --> 01:03:53.448
This will hurt me
more than it hurts you.

602
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:55.217
What?

603
01:03:55.219 --> 01:03:56.820
All right.

604
01:03:57.422 --> 01:03:59.891
You're all right.
You're all right.

605
01:04:01.192 --> 01:04:03.294
All right. It's all right.

606
01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:06.465
It's done.

607
01:04:18.843 --> 01:04:20.312
Rest now.

608
01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:26.351
Will you stay with me?

609
01:04:28.221 --> 01:04:29.956
I'm not going anywhere.

610
01:05:02.154 --> 01:05:05.391
Vogel! We found it! Yeah!

611
01:05:08.294 --> 01:05:12.530
Yeah! Come on! We found it!

612
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:21.270
I found it.

613
01:05:21.272 --> 01:05:23.007
Send the transport.

614
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.613
I thought you'd gone.

615
01:06:04.615 --> 01:06:06.016
Usually when I see you
on this island.

616
01:06:06.018 --> 01:06:07.519
it's you who disappears.

617
01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:32.843
Let me do that.

618
01:06:34.113 --> 01:06:35.447
Come here.

619
01:06:41.818 --> 01:06:44.755
So. sprout.
where did you end up?

620
01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:47.926
Did you go
to Oxford or Cambridge?

621
01:06:50.628 --> 01:06:52.695
Come on. which was it?

622
01:06:52.697 --> 01:06:54.532
You know what. Dad?

623
01:06:55.633 --> 01:06:58.668
I didn't go to university.

624
01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:02.371
Well. there's time yet.
You're still only a child.

625
01:07:02.373 --> 01:07:06.342
No. I was a child
when you left me.

626
01:07:06.344 --> 01:07:07.713
Ah. careful.

627
01:07:15.753 --> 01:07:18.720
Hardest day of my life

628
01:07:18.722 --> 01:07:21.425
when I gave up
trying to get back to you.

629
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.432
But I realized
she'd never let me leave.

630
01:07:31.702 --> 01:07:35.375
What are you talking about?
Who's "she"?

631
01:07:35.773 --> 01:07:37.042
Himiko.

632
01:07:38.977 --> 01:07:42.179
Trinity had sent Vogel
to find her tomb

633
01:07:42.181 --> 01:07:44.646
so that he could wake her
and get her power.

634
01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:46.584
I had to stop them.

635
01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:50.586
Right.

636
01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:53.324
Vogel can't find the tomb
without me.

637
01:07:53.326 --> 01:07:55.892
And since I'm dead

638
01:07:55.894 --> 01:07:58.998
and since you've burnt
the rest of my research.

639
01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:01.466
he'll never find it.

640
01:08:03.236 --> 01:08:04.468
So...

641
01:08:06.138 --> 01:08:07.671
About that.

642
01:08:09.773 --> 01:08:11.740
What part of
"burn all my papers"

643
01:08:11.742 --> 01:08:13.876
did you not understand?

644
01:08:13.878 --> 01:08:17.414
If I'd burned the papers.
I wouldn't have found you.

645
01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:20.883
I set diversions and false
leads wherever I could.

646
01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:23.519
I watched for years
as they got it wrong.

647
01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:25.355
And now you lead them
by the hand.

648
01:08:25.357 --> 01:08:29.628
So a gun-toting psychopath
finds some ancient remains.

649
01:08:30.394 --> 01:08:32.161
So what?

650
01:08:32.163 --> 01:08:34.364
If Vogel opens that tomb.

651
01:08:34.366 --> 01:08:37.968
Himiko's curse will be
unleashed on the world.

652
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.635
Dad. listen...

653
01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:42.840
You coming here was a mistake.

654
01:08:48.646 --> 01:08:51.280
I came here to find out
what happened to you.

655
01:08:51.282 --> 01:08:53.118
So long as the tomb was safe.

656
01:08:53.617 --> 01:08:55.818
you were safe.

657
01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:58.557
I was trying to keep you safe.

658
01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:01.991
But I underestimated your...

659
01:09:01.993 --> 01:09:03.129
My what?

660
01:09:05.662 --> 01:09:07.665
- Stupidity?
- No.

661
01:09:11.403 --> 01:09:13.039
Your bravery.

662
01:09:19.077 --> 01:09:21.210
We have to get off
this island.

663
01:09:21.212 --> 01:09:22.877
There's no way off. Lara.

664
01:09:22.879 --> 01:09:24.814
Vogel's got a satellite phone.

665
01:09:24.816 --> 01:09:26.582
We can get to it.
We can call for help.

666
01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:28.317
Vogel has an army.

667
01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.621
You were the one who taught me
to never give up.

668
01:09:33.925 --> 01:09:36.094
That was a different time.

669
01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:39.798
When I was a different man.

670
01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:54.745
- Lara.
- Well. I'm still his daughter.

671
01:09:56.181 --> 01:09:57.516
Lara!

672
01:10:20.504 --> 01:10:21.872
Come on!

673
01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:46.595
Try another combination.

674
01:10:46.597 --> 01:10:49.699
And another one.
and another one.

675
01:10:57.910 --> 01:11:01.244
Come on. Come on.
give me the damn code.

676
01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:14.856
Hey. We're trying
the explosives again.

677
01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.392
Set another charge.

678
01:11:16.394 --> 01:11:17.796
Yes. boss.

679
01:11:40.184 --> 01:11:42.784
Get over there.
Stop talking.

680
01:11:56.167 --> 01:11:58.467
Get the guns.
I'm gonna get the sat phone.

681
01:11:58.469 --> 01:12:00.735
Then we'll find a way for all
of us to get out of here.

682
01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:02.338
We need to leave now.

683
01:12:11.916 --> 01:12:14.953
Vogel! They re escaping!

684
01:12:22.559 --> 01:12:24.095
Go!

685
01:12:24.495 --> 01:12:26.331
Shoot them!

686
01:12:42.613 --> 01:12:44.749
- Get them to safety.
- Okay.

687
01:12:49.086 --> 01:12:51.720
I'll be right behind you. Go.

688
01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:41.703
Shit.

689
01:13:52.616 --> 01:13:54.151
We have to move.

690
01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:55.818
I have to wait here.

691
01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.189
I'm not leaving Lara behind.

692
01:14:24.248 --> 01:14:26.385
It's beautiful.
isn't it. Richard?

693
01:14:29.687 --> 01:14:31.420
I wish I would've known
that you were alive

694
01:14:31.422 --> 01:14:33.224
all these years.

695
01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:36.894
At least I would've had
somebody to talk to.

696
01:14:49.772 --> 01:14:52.040
I need your help. Richard.

697
01:14:52.042 --> 01:14:54.443
Get the door open for me.

698
01:14:54.445 --> 01:14:56.678
It's been seven years.

699
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.447
I'm going home
to see my family.

700
01:14:58.449 --> 01:15:01.287
If I open that tomb.
you won't have a family.

701
01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.922
Open it!

702
01:15:05.357 --> 01:15:06.523
Open it!

703
01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:08.827
Open it!

704
01:15:09.594 --> 01:15:10.594
Never!

705
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.663
Have it your way.

706
01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:18.836
With or without you.
I'm getting inside that tomb.

707
01:15:27.412 --> 01:15:28.446
Put that down!

708
01:15:30.948 --> 01:15:32.749
Put it down.

709
01:15:33.683 --> 01:15:35.383
You don't think
I can pull this trigger

710
01:15:35.385 --> 01:15:36.986
before you hit me
with that arrow.

711
01:15:36.988 --> 01:15:38.555
Shoot him. Lara. Shoot him!

712
01:15:39.123 --> 01:15:41.057
Come on. put your weapon down.

713
01:15:41.059 --> 01:15:43.329
Shoot him. Lara. We can't
let him get to Himiko.

714
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:48.497
You really don't believe
this nonsense. do you?

715
01:15:48.499 --> 01:15:52.302
Tell your father to
open the door. or he's dead.

716
01:15:52.304 --> 01:15:54.671
You can make him do it. Lara.

717
01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:57.906
Transport's already
on its way.

718
01:15:57.908 --> 01:16:00.876
We can all be
off this goddamn island.

719
01:16:00.878 --> 01:16:02.578
Let him shoot me.

720
01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.583
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

721
01:16:08.053 --> 01:16:11.053
It's your decision.

722
01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:12.891
It's your finger
that's pulling this trigger.

723
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.399
- I'm sorry.
- No.

724
01:16:23.534 --> 01:16:26.670
I haven't come all this way
to see you die.

725
01:16:32.844 --> 01:16:34.313
I'll do it.

726
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.086
I'll open it.

727
01:16:45.888 --> 01:16:48.425
Finally. a Croft
with some sense.

728
01:18:24.722 --> 01:18:26.257
Ladies first.

729
01:18:53.218 --> 01:18:55.086
Mark the path.

730
01:19:27.218 --> 01:19:29.319
She's still breathing.

731
01:19:29.321 --> 01:19:31.954
Or it's a change in
atmospheric pressure.

732
01:19:31.956 --> 01:19:33.424
Keep walking.

733
01:19:50.108 --> 01:19:51.742
You should've seen
the look on your...

734
01:20:05.589 --> 01:20:08.127
That wasn't designed
to keep people out.

735
01:20:10.129 --> 01:20:12.160
That was put there
to keep people in.

736
01:20:12.162 --> 01:20:13.397
Dad?

737
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:49.300
Chasm of Souls.

738
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:46.824
You go next.

739
01:22:00.504 --> 01:22:04.608
"Pray to survive
the faces of Himiko."

740
01:22:05.108 --> 01:22:06.509
We're getting closer.

741
01:22:10.747 --> 01:22:15.250
"The Death Queen
turns day to night.

742
01:22:15.252 --> 01:22:18.455
"She must die
to bring back life."

743
01:22:24.062 --> 01:22:25.429
Oh. shit.

744
01:22:37.407 --> 01:22:38.675
- The floor!
- Lara!

745
01:22:48.451 --> 01:22:50.454
There's gotta be a way
to stop this.

746
01:22:51.956 --> 01:22:53.456
Look around!

747
01:22:55.393 --> 01:22:57.592
Come on. Come on!

748
01:22:57.594 --> 01:22:59.797
Vogel. what's going on?

749
01:23:13.912 --> 01:23:15.277
"Pray to survive."

750
01:23:15.279 --> 01:23:18.082
It's a keyhole. We need a key!

751
01:23:19.283 --> 01:23:20.750
The prayer wheels!

752
01:23:25.689 --> 01:23:26.723
Lara!

753
01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:32.761
It's not working.

754
01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:34.432
Check the other prayer wheels.

755
01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:36.467
Try this!

756
01:23:40.803 --> 01:23:42.139
No.

757
01:23:42.306 --> 01:23:43.540
Wait.

758
01:23:47.045 --> 01:23:48.046
It's a color puzzle.

759
01:23:51.049 --> 01:23:54.316
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

760
01:23:54.318 --> 01:23:56.753
- Black.
- Black! Here!

761
01:23:58.422 --> 01:23:59.488
Shit!

762
01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:00.724
Blue!

763
01:24:02.326 --> 01:24:03.458
No!

764
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:04.729
Here!

765
01:24:06.096 --> 01:24:07.497
It doesn't work.

766
01:24:09.134 --> 01:24:10.135
Lara!

767
01:24:17.341 --> 01:24:19.610
Last one! Yellow!

768
01:24:26.549 --> 01:24:28.317
It's not working.

769
01:24:28.319 --> 01:24:30.519
Just try them all. damn it!

770
01:24:30.521 --> 01:24:33.454
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

771
01:24:33.456 --> 01:24:35.290
"She must die
to bring back..."

772
01:24:35.292 --> 01:24:36.557
"Life."

773
01:24:36.559 --> 01:24:37.929
Come on!

774
01:24:39.729 --> 01:24:41.598
The color of life.

775
01:24:47.437 --> 01:24:49.107
I'm running out of floor!

776
01:24:56.281 --> 01:24:57.615
Green!

777
01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:23.437
You always were the brains
of the family. sprout.

778
01:25:27.245 --> 01:25:29.546
Well. let's get going. sprout.

779
01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.922
Where's the floor?

780
01:25:38.055 --> 01:25:39.056
Gone.

781
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:54.472
Flare.

782
01:26:10.653 --> 01:26:12.522
Come on. Lara.

783
01:26:14.892 --> 01:26:16.127
I'm going back for her.

784
01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.328
I'm coming with you.

785
01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:21.166
You dad gave his life for us.

786
01:26:59.069 --> 01:27:04.308
Himiko's army of
a thousand handmaidens.

787
01:27:05.242 --> 01:27:08.575
They sacrificed themselves
in ritual suicide

788
01:27:08.577 --> 01:27:10.880
to serve their queen
in the afterlife.

789
01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:18.889
Exactly as your notes.

790
01:27:21.425 --> 01:27:22.626
We found her.

791
01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.223
All right. this is it.
We're finishing this.

792
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:55.958
It's not too late
to change your mind.

793
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.592
There's a very big difference

794
01:27:57.594 --> 01:27:59.860
between myth and reality.
Richard.

795
01:27:59.862 --> 01:28:02.833
Something that you could
never understand.

796
01:28:03.732 --> 01:28:04.935
Gentlemen.

797
01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.655
Open it.

798
01:29:08.965 --> 01:29:12.601
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

799
01:29:12.603 --> 01:29:14.435
It's just...

800
01:29:14.437 --> 01:29:16.241
...a little old lady.

801
01:29:19.143 --> 01:29:21.011
Prepare her for transport.

802
01:29:29.585 --> 01:29:31.422
Something doesn't add up.

803
01:29:32.455 --> 01:29:35.826
She's not a monster
in any of these paintings.

804
01:29:41.398 --> 01:29:44.434
It looks like she was
taking herself here.

805
01:29:48.238 --> 01:29:49.872
Not being forced.

806
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:55.443
The Death Queen
turns day to night.

807
01:29:55.445 --> 01:29:57.846
She must die
to bring back life.

808
01:29:57.848 --> 01:29:59.417
"Bring back life."

809
01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.785
Spreading
death and destruction

810
01:30:04.787 --> 01:30:06.027
with just the touch
of her hand.

811
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:08.992
Go on.

812
01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:13.461
All myths have
foundation in reality.

813
01:30:13.463 --> 01:30:15.164
...in reality.

814
01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:17.235
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

815
01:30:18.701 --> 01:30:19.970
Wait!

816
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:24.474
She was sacrificing herself.

817
01:30:26.776 --> 01:30:28.913
She was protecting the world.

818
01:30:44.095 --> 01:30:45.627
See?

819
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:47.364
Smoke and mirrors.

820
01:30:49.732 --> 01:30:51.834
All right. let's bag her up.
Come on.

821
01:31:11.956 --> 01:31:13.925
They thought it was magic.

822
01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:22.065
She was a carrier.

823
01:31:23.566 --> 01:31:24.867
She was immune.

824
01:31:32.343 --> 01:31:33.844
It's a disease.

825
01:32:26.495 --> 01:32:29.831
This is what Trinity wants.
This gets me home.

826
01:32:29.833 --> 01:32:34.138
If you take this out
into the world. it's genocide.

827
01:32:40.176 --> 01:32:44.181
I just need to take
a very small piece of you.

828
01:33:39.602 --> 01:33:41.973
Go! Get her! Get her!

829
01:34:02.558 --> 01:34:04.927
Well. this is it. Richard.

830
01:34:04.929 --> 01:34:07.195
All we have to do
is walk out of here.

831
01:34:07.197 --> 01:34:08.598
You're not going anywhere.

832
01:34:20.543 --> 01:34:22.246
Come on. Richard.

833
01:34:24.813 --> 01:34:26.349
Think of your daughter.

834
01:34:35.024 --> 01:34:36.459
Come on.

835
01:34:37.727 --> 01:34:39.063
Come on.

836
01:36:32.943 --> 01:36:35.011
- Dad.
- Lara.

837
01:36:35.245 --> 01:36:37.012
Vogel's gone.

838
01:36:37.014 --> 01:36:39.981
- You need to go after him.
- Come on. let's go.

839
01:36:39.983 --> 01:36:42.752
- No. stay back. Stay back.
- What are you talking...

840
01:36:45.687 --> 01:36:47.190
I'm done for.

841
01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:54.464
I'm infected.

842
01:36:56.866 --> 01:36:58.136
No.

843
01:37:01.404 --> 01:37:04.574
You can't touch me.
Don't touch.

844
01:37:05.607 --> 01:37:09.110
You must stop Vogel
and get the hell out of here.

845
01:37:09.112 --> 01:37:11.514
And I'll bury Himiko
once and for all.

846
01:37:13.183 --> 01:37:14.847
I've only just found you.

847
01:37:14.849 --> 01:37:17.352
Promise me you'll stop him.
Promise me!

848
01:37:17.354 --> 01:37:18.987
There must be another way.

849
01:37:18.989 --> 01:37:20.721
Lara.

850
01:37:20.723 --> 01:37:23.493
You're a very. very
bright young woman.

851
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.463
There's no other way.

852
01:37:33.938 --> 01:37:36.172
I need you.

853
01:37:36.174 --> 01:37:39.776
No. you don't.
You're worth 10 of me.

854
01:37:42.179 --> 01:37:44.378
You said you don't
believe in magic.

855
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.916
Well. what's this. my darling?

856
01:37:47.283 --> 01:37:49.550
All this time here...

857
01:37:49.552 --> 01:37:52.286
I wished I could
see you grow up.

858
01:37:52.288 --> 01:37:53.886
No.

859
01:37:53.888 --> 01:37:55.557
And now I have.

860
01:37:55.959 --> 01:37:57.860
It's a miracle.

861
01:37:58.261 --> 01:38:00.361
Chin up. sprout.

862
01:38:00.363 --> 01:38:02.200
There's jobs to do.

863
01:38:04.733 --> 01:38:06.269
Go on. go!

864
01:38:07.536 --> 01:38:09.802
There's no time. Lara.

865
01:38:09.804 --> 01:38:10.807
Go on. go!

866
01:38:26.455 --> 01:38:28.225
Dad loves you.

867
01:38:32.428 --> 01:38:33.997
I love you.

868
01:39:28.785 --> 01:39:31.119
Oh. you really wanna
do this. little girl?

869
01:39:31.121 --> 01:39:32.656
Let's just go home.

870
01:39:46.403 --> 01:39:49.036
You're not savin' anyone.

871
01:39:49.038 --> 01:39:50.371
Trinity is everywhere.

872
01:39:53.277 --> 01:39:54.477
Yeah?

873
01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:35.617
I made a promise.

874
01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:42.855
No. No. No!

875
01:40:42.857 --> 01:40:44.893
You're not
getting out of here.

876
01:40:45.162 --> 01:40:46.663
No! No!

877
01:41:46.687 --> 01:41:48.057
When you see Richard.

878
01:41:49.393 --> 01:41:51.194
send him my regards.

879
01:42:32.601 --> 01:42:33.836
Send them yourself.

880
01:42:51.121 --> 01:42:53.622
You messed
with the wrong family.

881
01:44:52.175 --> 01:44:53.709
Lara!

882
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:01.385
Lara!

883
01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.691
Lara?

884
01:45:53.403 --> 01:45:55.038
Well...

885
01:45:55.437 --> 01:45:56.940
We're not dead yet.

886
01:46:01.344 --> 01:46:03.013
No shit.

887
01:46:27.635 --> 01:46:31.708
Vogel. Vogel. this is
Patna Transport Bravo 5. Over.

888
01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:37.413
Vogel. Vogel.
are you reading me? Over.

889
01:46:38.714 --> 01:46:39.950
Boss.

890
01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.988
You're takin' us home. yeah?

891
01:47:24.626 --> 01:47:27.694
Officially gone. Like magic.

892
01:47:27.696 --> 01:47:29.695
I don't think he has gone.

893
01:47:31.433 --> 01:47:34.537
- I see so much of him in you.
- Thanks. Ana.

894
01:47:34.736 --> 01:47:36.405
Really.

895
01:47:37.073 --> 01:47:39.308
You're in charge now. Lara.

896
01:47:40.911 --> 01:47:43.810
This is a list
of all our assets.

897
01:47:43.812 --> 01:47:45.678
Thank you.

898
01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.847
No. I think you'd better stay

899
01:47:47.849 --> 01:47:49.650
on top of
the day-to-day things. Ana.

900
01:47:49.652 --> 01:47:52.052
Well. as you wish.

901
01:47:52.054 --> 01:47:54.054
Boardrooms and business deals.

902
01:47:54.056 --> 01:47:56.556
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

903
01:48:03.764 --> 01:48:07.370
Neither was Dad.
as it turns out.

904
01:48:22.085 --> 01:48:24.953
Are all these companies
owned by us?

905
01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.355
Yes.

906
01:49:07.562 --> 01:49:09.796
I know them
by name now...

907
01:49:09.798 --> 01:49:12.035
The Order of Trinity.

908
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:15.802
An ancient
militant organization

909
01:49:15.804 --> 01:49:18.306
that seeks control
over the supernatural

910
01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:21.178
in order to rule
the fate of mankind.

911
01:49:24.647 --> 01:49:27.815
What kind of work
do you do?

912
01:49:27.817 --> 01:49:32.219
Oh. a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.

913
01:49:32.221 --> 01:49:34.992
Are all these companies
owned by us?

914
01:49:37.292 --> 01:49:39.394
You're not
savin' anyone.

915
01:49:40.028 --> 01:49:43.164
Trinity is everywhere.

916
01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:45.199
I know it's difficult
to accept.

917
01:49:45.201 --> 01:49:48.238
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

918
01:49:49.171 --> 01:49:51.137
I think
you'd better stay

919
01:49:51.139 --> 01:49:52.708
on top of
the day-to-day things. Ana.

920
01:49:53.041 --> 01:49:54.909
As you wish.

921
01:49:54.911 --> 01:49:57.012
The only person
that I get to talk to

922
01:49:57.014 --> 01:49:59.416
is on the other end
of this phone.

923
01:50:09.392 --> 01:50:11.325
You must understand.

924
01:50:11.327 --> 01:50:14.164
We Crofts.
we have responsibilities.

925
01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:18.100
Jobs to do.

926
01:50:27.977 --> 01:50:30.478
Oh. You again.

927
01:50:33.116 --> 01:50:35.048
I came back for the amulet.

928
01:50:35.050 --> 01:50:37.384
Shame. I was hoping
you'd forgotten.

929
01:50:37.386 --> 01:50:39.186
It's worth a bloody fortune.

930
01:50:39.188 --> 01:50:41.488
I did tell you
it was your lucky day.

931
01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:42.822
Yes. you did.

932
01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.364
- At it again. are we. Alan?
- I'm not at it.

933
01:50:54.237 --> 01:50:56.435
I don't know
if you've noticed or not.

934
01:50:56.437 --> 01:50:58.271
but. uh. you can't be
too careful these days

935
01:50:58.273 --> 01:51:00.408
because the world
has gone bloody mad.

936
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:02.874
Yes. yes. thank you. Alan.

937
01:51:02.876 --> 01:51:07.280
What you got there is
a HK USP 9 mil. extended mag.

938
01:51:07.282 --> 01:51:09.218
It's my personal favorite.

939
01:51:12.154 --> 01:51:13.954
You like that?

940
01:51:13.956 --> 01:51:15.056
I do.

941
01:51:15.058 --> 01:51:16.259
Mmm.

942
01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:19.729
I'll take two.

943
01:51:21.924 --> 01:51:26.929
